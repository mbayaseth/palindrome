In this algorithm, we check the first and last characters of the word. If they are the same, we continue checking the rest of the word (excluding the first and last characters) using a recursive call. If the first and last characters are different, we can conclude that the word is not a palindrome.

Here's how the algorithm works:

If the word is empty or has only one character, it's considered a palindrome (base case).
If the first and last characters of the word are the same, we continue the recursive check with the rest of the word, excluding the first and last characters.
If the first and last characters are different, we conclude that the word is not a palindrome.
This algorithm will work for checking if a given word is a palindrome.
